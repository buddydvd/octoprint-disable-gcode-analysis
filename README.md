# OctoPrint Disable Gcode Analysis

This plugin disables OctoPrint's background gcode analysis worker queue. You might want this if you want to mount a network-shared folder to OctoPrint's "uploads" folder. Doing so allows you to access gcode files across multiple OctoPrint instances.

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager)
or manually using this URL:
